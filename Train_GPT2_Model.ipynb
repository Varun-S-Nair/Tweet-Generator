      "There is no such thing as free trade, they just have other people come and take our jobs. The world owes us a lot!\n",
      "It is a travesty and disgrace that the U.S. has such a low tariff rate. We should have a 35% tariff rate, but we don’t. Why should I be allowed to come into the U.S. and buy things that sell for much less than me?\n",
      "Can you believe that the Democrats have lost more Legislative Midterms than Republicans. They make a mockery of the very work that was done by the Democrats in the Senate. Why is it that their agenda is not helping, or is doing nothing, the American people?\n",

      "A BIG and LOUD JOB for the President to be able to Make the decision to HOLD or RESIGN, and then to LOSE the Election in 2020!\n",
      "The Fake News Media has gone totally mad! They report and write whatever they want, like never before. Fake, Fake news!\n",

This is an emergency in his heart.” @Varneyco @seanhannity @FoxNews And so the Radical Left is running around the country trying to blame this President for whatever happened in the 2016 Campaign. This should never be allowed!\n",

Also, the Democrats are losing elections (and I mean that literally) and can’t win them all. Pick up Red Hen and the Sun - WIN!\n",
      "Congratulations to a great man (a great man for a President) on the great success of his interview with Steve Hilton on 60 Minutes. Great job Steve!\n",
      "The U.S. Economy is looking very strong, in my opinion, even greater than anticipated by the Fake Critics and losers in the markets. We have entered an era where the Markets will PROVE themselves, and we will prove to be one of the strongest, if not the strongest, on the Planet!\n",
      "Great job, by Republican Candidates, of Federal Judge in Arizona on Russian involvement in America’s political system (incidentally, on me, by the way) - so far we have not had to testify, or be brought before Congress, as has been requested. I look forward to helping them in the future!\n",
      "The Fake News wants to stay as far away as possible from Russia as possible in order to weaken the already very corrupt Democrat Party. The fact is, the Russian “Entourage” of stolen documents, including the DNC Emails, have been made widely available, and for a reason. The Failing New York Times thinks it is highly inappropriate to release them. Disgraceful!\n",
      "So, the Russian “Entourage” of stolen documents, including the DNC Emails, got just a sliver of the Trump victory, and the story goes on and on and on. The Russian “Enemy” has now made very serious allegations, some of which are true, that the “Enemy” stole the Trump Campaign Emails. Do you imagine that this is true? What do the Do Nothing Democrats have to show to prove that I was right? So Many Whoppers!\n",
      "I will be having an interview today on “60 Minutes.” That’s right, Stephen Miller was working on \"60 Minutes\" before he started his pathetic Fake Statement. He worked for a while, you can say goodbye to Brian Ross. Maybe he was even on the same show as Matt Lauer. So much for Lauer being open, but it wasn’t his fault!\n",

      "The United States, together with Canada, have just suspended the entry of highly enriched uranium rods into the country from Canada - a very good thing, because it frees the United States and Canada to do many good things. At the same time, the World is safe for our workers, but we are doing NOTHING about the Russians, China, or the DO NOTHING to stop them. Nothing good for the World!\n",
      "China has a very good argument that they have been treated unfairly for many years, through no fault of their own but, instead, the Obama Administrations actions, like NAFTA, the regulations, the V.A. Don’t forget our big and important WIN against the DO NOTHING illegal Russian Witch Hunt. I will soon be addressing the Chinese people directly, for the first time, about our big DO NOTHING victory against the Russian Witch Hunt!\n",
      "The U.S. Senate should introduce real changes to CISA and the PATRIOT act, not pretend that these are different things. There should not be 140 year old laws that are rarely used, let alone 5 year old laws. Change them now and get real results. It will be a big win for our workers, businesses and freedom!\n",

      "The Democrats just aren’t giving us help on our Southern Border Security Bill. They are blocking everything, including Justice. If they get this bill, we will be forced to use whatever is necessary. I stand ready to go, and always have!\n",

      "It wouldn’t be too Shifty for the Do Nothing Democrats to borrow money from their secret and very thick Dividend Policy to keep the lights on at night. Then, whenever the lights go out, they say it was a Democrat/Fraud Hoax, and we deserve it!\n",
      "It’s amazing what I’ve done in the last two years, with @$$$@$$$@ being the biggest President, biggest White House Celebrant, biggest Twitter User, biggest Video Creator, biggest Walmart Buyer, biggest Hottest Seller and so much more. It would be totally possible for this very busy President to get distracted by these many things at the same time!\n",

      " bigger for our country, they are so desperate for success, they are blowing it all and looking for a way out. They tried and failed so many times, and now it is all going to end. They failed so badly, they deserve their bad reputation. They are going crazy!\n",
      "Our economy is the envy of the world, and it should be doing much better than it is. If this is the kind of success the U.S. is looking for, no amount of increased taxes will get you out of the doldrums. We are taking in Billions, and having many millions of new jobs- it will all come together!\n",
      "“The Democrats want to escape responsibility for the economy by blaming Republicans. Ineffective and costly - but hey, at least they are trying!” @LouDobbs  The Economy is doing great!\n",
      "If the Republicans & the American people truly want to WIN in 2020, “X” must be the kind of victory that brings Democrats (and others) together, rather than tearing apart and demoralization. Dems are just looking for an excuse to do horrible things, and nothing will satisfy their hateful agenda!\n",
      "It is shameful that the FBI is still withholding key evidence from the Senate Committee on Intelligence, including Agent Strzok’s diary, from which the Strzok Report is based. This latest development must be the smoking gun that proves “there was a campaign against the Trump Campaign.” If there is any racism, bribery or something more, it has nothing to do with Donald J. Trump!\n",
      "The Democrats are now blaming RUSSIA and Russia for the horrible attack in Sweden. Obama was totally at fault. Obama had no clue! But just like they didn’t want to talk about Crooked Hillary, they don’t want to talk about the many crimes committed by Crooked Hillary.\n",
      "So now the Obama FBI is admitting that they suppressed key evidence from the Crooked Hillary Clinton Email probe (Which the FBI was legally required to do). This contradicts everything the Democrats have been saying all along, that the Committee was illegally treated - and much else!\n",
      "The Obama FBI was set up by the Democrats, and used against the Trump Campaign. Remember, this was a big political and economic victory for the Dems. They couldn’t stop him - they didn’t even want to go to the courts. This is all a big political and excuse for Hillary losing the election.\n",
      "Just remember, the FBI was illegally set up, and used, against the Trump Campaign. They had no idea who was really in control & didn’t even want to go to court to stop themselves. They were completely out of control - But yeah, totally at the Democrats’s request!\n",
      "HAPPY 4TH OF JULY!\n",
      "Republicans love our country, but they don’t like the fact that we are now producing more than a Ford Fusion with Mexico. They also love the fact that our taxes and tariff bills are coming way down with each passing day. That’s because we are doing really well with Mexico and the U.S.B.T.\n",
      "I’m in the Great State of Michigan at the Trump Taj Mahal. It is a special place. Would be a great venue for a great speech - Rallies are greatly encouraged!\n",
      "The United States has a $25 billion trade deficit with Mexico, and we are changing that at the Border! We will soon be a net buyer of Motor Vehicles as our industries expand throughout our country.\n",
      "We have just signed a very important Bill on Energy. Much of the debate has centered on the fact that we have Energy Sector Drilling right under our noses - by executive privilege! This is a problem, and we will get it fixed!\n",
      "Has anyone noticed that the top shows on @foxnews are those that are Fair (or great!) to your favorite President, me! Congratulations to @seanhannity for being the number one show on Cable Television!\n",
      "Wow, 11 people killed in Venezuela explosion - terrible, but Venezuela's socialist government is looking the other way as U.S. prices and food prices skyrocket. Damage so great, and death toll so high. Can this possibly get any worse?\n",
      "Will be going to Dayton, Ohio, today for a really big Rally. Love the GOP, and all, but MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\n",
      "My @America’sVoice knocks on doors all over the country with the message, “We want Trump.” Unfortunately, the Democrats have a very different vision. Wacky Donna Haraway is unable to see the big picture!\n",
      "The U.S. is growing more and more vulnerable as it heads south. A big and bloody Earthquake in California was 6.7 on the Richter Scale. We want safety & wealth, but we don’t want Trump!\n",

They don’t want to do TV anymore, they don’t want to report the truth, they don’t want to correct their mistakes, they want to destroy! Not fair to U.S.\n",

They should immediately release their Server and explain what is going on. It’s a Fake News Media, but they are losing too much!\n",

He knew from the beginning that these would be non-negotiable. He had no intention of changing his mind. Where is the apology to me? Can’t believe the Republicans would do such a thing!\n",
